//! Pure, bounded, deny-only shell syntax analysis for trusted host commands.
//!
//! Hosts supply exact tool bindings and basename/positional-prefix rules. Paths
//! are never resolved. Unsupported syntax denies; an abstention is not approval.
//! Runtime guard registration and capacity enforcement remain separate work.
//!
//! Analysis supports the admitted POSIX/Bash grammar, simple parameter words,
//! substitutions, conditionals, loops, cases, redirects and bounded delegation
//! through `env`, `command`, `exec`, `sudo`, `timeout`, `sh` and `bash`. It walks
//! every branch and executable substitution, including commands that would not
//! execute on the current shell's path. Arithmetic, functions, arrays, opaque
//! builtin operand interpretation and unsupported wrapper options deny. This
//! structural inventory is an analysis boundary, not a danger catalog.
//!
//! Basename/prefix rules cannot recognize `git -C . push`, execution via
//! `nohup`, `nice`, `ionice`, `xargs`, `find -exec`, `busybox`, `ssh`, `python -c`,
//! `perl -e`, `node -e`, `make`, or host-defined functions and aliases. This is
//! trusted syntax inspection, not a sandbox. Hosts own trust, permissions,
//! credentials, provisioning and execution environment. A configuration hash
//! includes canonical bindings/rules, all limits and versioned behavior.
//!
//! There is no raw JSON byte channel: serde_json has resolved duplicate keys
//! and UTF-8 before analysis. JSON key/string work has a separate
//! `max_analysis_bytes` cap; script budgets are shared across nested shell and
//! decoded backquote scripts. Depth is shared with wrappers and hard-capped
//! at 32, measured on a 512 KiB debug thread. The reference's comment-continuation
//! and POSIX Bash ambiguities are denied conservatively. See the repository's
//! extension-parity document and reference fixture instructions for differences.
